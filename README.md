# Iroha-CLI

Command Line Interface written in Python for use with Iroha Distributed Ledger

#Please Note

Required:
Python 3.6+ (3.7 used in developent)
create venv
pip install requirements.txt

This iteration is currently being worked on to include all features.

I am aware of the missing features, but feel free to fork and contribute further.

I believe it currently reverts to default values specified and is a bit buggy.

Works with default admin@test supplied
